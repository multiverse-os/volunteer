# Multiverse OS: Volunteer 
Multiverse OS is maintained by three lead developers who work part-time to full-time depending on schedule availability, who all hope to move to full-time as the project matures and the community grows. But by design, the Multiverse OS project, is open source; but also openly and transparently developed, community members with a variety of skill sets interested in contributing are welcome to volunteer their time, skills and other resources to the Multiverse OS and associated software in the Multiverse OS ecosystem. 


#### Volunteering 
If you are interested in participating in Multiverse OS development, community
organizing, writing or editing documentation, design, or other tasks. Please
either issue a pull request to the keyring or email the active development team at developers@multiverse-os.org or volunteer@multiverse-os.org with your public key you will use to identify yourself (PGP or eventually scramble key). 

After submitting your public key, include in the introduction issue in this repository; or by email a brief introduction with your relevant skillset, availability. Once received, an active member of the development team or community organizer will read it over and reach out to active team members of the development, design or editors with similar skills, and start making introductions. With the goal being to help you get quickly aquainted with the relevant community members that will help you get started as quickly as possible, and in a way that utilizes your volunteer time in the efficient way so that as little time as possible is wasted and to allow you to maximize your donated time. We value every hour of time donated by our community and we want to show through the action of effective project organization.

#### Multiverse Community Web Application
A development journal, and nucleating point for the community is being developed to be hosted at https://multiverse-os.org; Until this this repoistory will serve as the temporary location, but all data such as keys and introductions will be migrated.
