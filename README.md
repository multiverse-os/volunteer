## Multiverse OS Foundation: Getting started volunteering 
**URL** [multiverse-os.org](https://multiverse-os.org)


Multiverse OS development is currently driven by a small group of dedicated
full-time volunteers who are dedicated to bringing Multiverse OS and related
applications, protocols, and tools online. 

#### Alpha Release
We are nearing our alpha release, which will be the first release will an
installer; meaning it will no longer require specialized knowledge, and will be
as simple as inserting installation media, after using a simple tool Multiverse
OS developers provide to boot to a installation process. 

Our hope is to have both a live media, and installation media for the alpha
release but we may only be able to reach the goal of installation media. 

The installation will provide both a GUI, and a console based TUI installation
process. The installation will be as straight forward and easy-to-use as we can
with alpha-level software, but if you have any questions; please reach out to
the development team using support@multiverse-os.org. 

#### How can I Help? 
If you are interested in helping please email us at volunteer@multiverse-os.org;
we need a wide variety of skillsets, ranging from moderators, support
leadership, artists (graphic, audio, 3D/CAD, and more), Q/A testers, security
researchers for peer-review, and there will be development tools for developers
with a wide range of skill from novice to advance to make use of to create
new Controllers, ApplicationVMs, extensions for the window manager, and other
community tools based on the Multiverse OS base protocols. This work can be done
indepedently and can seek support from our development team
development@multiverse-os.org 

Community members are welcome to contact to us about joining the core
development team; regarldess of your skill level, we can find a task that is
near or around your skill level, provide peer-review of code submitted, and
support and encouragement. We are in the process of developmeing a community and
need people from a wide variety of backgrounds, from community organizing,
fundraising, and project management to help establish the Multiverse OS
Foundation.

The Multiverse OS Foundation will be an open source workers owned and operated 
cooperative using the Gravity protocol to execute the charter using 
decentralized P2P software. 

As well as be legally registered in countries around the world as a
cooperative so that the organization can function completely with the legal
system and eventually begin hiring and compensating volunteers for their time. 

If you are interested in learning more about open source internationa
cooperatives, open source development, worker owned cooperatives, and open
source collectives; contact us, so we can know when it is right to bring our
forums online, start a mailing list and begin open and transparent discussions. 

#### Have art resources you wish to contribute? 
Issue a pull request on this repository, we are looking for icon sets, logos,
alternative concept designs for our window manager and other applications,
system sounds, design concepts, documentation, and remember, third-party tools
will also need similar resources for their applications, and if we work as a
community to provide them, we all benefit.
