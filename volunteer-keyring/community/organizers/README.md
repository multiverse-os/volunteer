# Organizers 
Community organizers are volunteers interested in adminstrative duties
associated with running the Multiverse OS Foundation. Community members who take
it upon themselves to community organize, establish social media, build software
to spread updates, alerts, and news. Organizers will most likely be selected for
administrative work once the Multiverse OS Foundation is live depending on their
past history, and qualtiy of work as a volunteer.
