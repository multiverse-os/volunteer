# Developer Keyring
#==============================================================================
The developer keyring is a place where lead Multiverse OS developers and the
volunteer community can publish their public identity keys (PGP or Scramble Key) in a centralized location so future releases, builds, documentation and eventually community discussions can be verified. 

We encourage all volunteer developers to issue a pull requests or email developers@multiverse-os.org with a brief description of your relevant skillset.

### Community Keyring
Active Multiverse OS developers are working on a web application that will provide a variety of community oriented services including a community keyring, and keyserver for both PGP and the new Multiverse OS scramble key standard. 

Multiverse OS git repositories will eventually migrate there and be mirrored here. 

This developer keyring will be migrated and maintained, so this is not temporary and should be considered the official developer keyring.
